# Express Protocol

The Express Protocol encapsulates a combination of Smart Contracts and Libraries, as well as a Software Development Kit, build on top of them.

---

The Smart Contracts interact directly with the blockchains(multiple supported).

These smart contracts have functionalities to mint, trade and auction tokens of [ERC721](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-721/) and [ERC1155](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-1155/) Standards.

---

The SDK built on top of the Smart Contracts enable clients to use the Protocol's Smart Contracts functionalities without directly interacting with the blockchain and smart contracts.
