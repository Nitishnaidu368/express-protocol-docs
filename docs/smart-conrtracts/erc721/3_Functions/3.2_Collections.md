Collections can be deployed using the deployERC721 function of the TokenFactory contract

```javascript
    deployERC721(
        string memory name,
        string memory symbol,
        string memory description,
        LibShare.Share[] memory royalties
    )
```

- **name**: Name of the collection
- **symbol**: Symbol of the collection
- **description**: Description of the collection
- **royalties**: array of [_Share_](/smart-conrtracts/erc721/Structs/Share/) struct

Tokens can be created inside collections and can be sold, bought, and auctioned.
