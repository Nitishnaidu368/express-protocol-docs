Collections can be deployed using the deployERC1155 function of the TokenFactory1155 contract

```javascript
    deployERC1155(
        string memory _uri, 
        string memory description, 
        LibShare.Share[] memory royalties
    )
```

- **_uri**: Base URI
- **description**: Description of the collection
- **royalties**: array of [_Share_](../Structs/Share.md) struct

Tokens can be created inside collections and can be sold, bought, and auctioned.
