Royalties for a token can be retrieved using getRoyalties function in both (PNDC_ERC1155 and TokenERC1155) contracts.

```javascript
    getRoyalties(
        uint256 _tokenId
    )
```

It returns an array of [_Share_](../Structs/Share.md) struct.

***

In the TokenERC1155 contract, there are additional functions for setting Royalties by token Id and for collections.

By TokenId-

```javascript
    setRoyaltiesByTokenId(
        uint256 _tokenId,
        RoyaltiesSet memory royaltiesSet
    )
```

- **\_tokenId**: Id of token whose royalty is getting set
- **royaltiesSet**: [_RoyaltiesSet_](../Structs/2_RoyalitiesSet.md) struct

  It emits an event:

```javascript
RoyaltiesSetForTokenId(_tokenId, royaltiesSet.royalties);
```

For Collections-

```javascript
    setRoyaltiesForCollection(
        LibShare.Share[] memory royalties
    )
```

- **royalties**: array of [_Share_](../Structs/Share.md) struct

  It emits an event:

```javascript
RoyaltiesSetForCollection(royalties);
```
